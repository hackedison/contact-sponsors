Hello %SPONSOR_NAME%,<br><br> 

I am Tarun Boddupalli from the HackEdison Team at Edison High School, New Jersey. My schoolâ€™s
Science National Honors Society is hosting a hackathon on Saturday, November 18th.<br><br> 

In case you are not aware, a hackathon is a coding competition in which programmers create various projects.
One of the most unique aspects of a hackathon is everything is free. Over a weekend, students
are exposed to an insightful experience in which they expand their knowledge of computer
programming and test their skills in a friendly coding competition. To keep this event free, we
require donations from willing sponsors who wish to support youth programs.<br><br>

We will be following up with more information about the specifics of the event and ways in
which you can also benefit from contributing. I look forward to hearing from you and hope that
you are interested in supporting our hackathon.<br><br>

Thank you,<br>
HackEdison Team<br><br>
